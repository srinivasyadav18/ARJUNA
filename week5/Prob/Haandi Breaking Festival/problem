In a school, Sri Krishna Shishu Mandir, during Janmaastami, a haandi (pot) breaking competition
was organized for kids to break the pots and win chocolates. For the competitions, N pots are
hanged in row (imagine as an array pots[]). So, the first pot is at pots[0] and last pot in the row
would be pots[N-1]. pots[i] is labelled with number indicating its worth.

The rule of the competition is as follows:

 Every time a pots[i] is broken then the kid will chocolates equal to products of worth of
pots[i-1] * pots[i] * pots[i+1].

 After a pots[i] is broken, it is removed and the total number of pots is reduced by one
and pots[i-1] and pots[i+1] become adjacent pots.

Now, Shyamlal likes chocolates very much so he wants to earn more chocolates in the
competition. Given the number of pots and their worth, find out the maximum number of
chocolates that Shyamlal can win by breaking the pots more intelligently.

Note:
You may imagine pots[-1] = pots[n] = 1. They are not real therefore you can not break them.


Example:

Input: 4
3 1 5 8
Output: 167 
Explanation: pots = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] -->   [3,8]   -->  [8]  --> []
             chocolates =  3*1*5      +  3*5*8    +  1*3*8      + 1*8*1   = 167
