A state road transport corporation is planning to introduce cargo bus services. The state has
identified a few towns that have need for such cargo services.
Each town has a Special Bus Terminal (SBT) where cargo is loaded and unloaded. Each SBT
several buses operating as part of cargo services. Here are a few operating rules:

 All towns are interconnected by single, bidirectional, no self-loop routes.

 There would be N towns (1 to N) and M undirected routes.

 Every SBT shall operate in two modes. (1) Busy (2) Transit. In Busy Mode, cargo is loaded
into the cargo buses and entry for cargo buses coming from other town is blocked and
they have to wait till the Busy Mode is switched to Transit Mode. In Transit Mode, cargo
buses will be leaving the current SBT for other cities.

 Every S hours the operating mode of SBTs is switched from Busy Mode to Transit Mode
and vice versa. Note: Initially all SBTs will be Transit Mode only.

 It could take T hours to move the cargo from one town to another town.

 The primary focus should be on saving fuel, on-time delivery of cargo.

Given information about the number of towns, routes, switching time and time taken to move
from source to target, find the lexicographically smallest path which will take the minimum
amount of time (in hours) required to move from town-X to town-Y and print two lines of
output. In the first line, print the total no of town-ids that one must go through to reach town-Y from town-
X and in the next line print the town-ids (separated by spaces) denoting the path that takes the
minimum amount of time (in hours) required to move from town-X and town-Y.

Sample input :
5 5 3 5
1 2
1 3
2 4
1 4
2 5
1 5

Sample output :
3
1 2 5

Explanation :

The first line contains 4 space separated integers, N, M, S and T.
Next M lines contains two space separated integers each, U and V
denoting that there is a bidirectional road between town U and town V.
Next line contains two space separated integers, X and Y.
Fastest path will be 1−>2−>5.
Reach town-2 in 5 hours. After 3 hours at the SBT in town-2 will change its
operating state to Busy. So in town-2, wait for 1 hour for the SBT to change
its operating state.
So total time will be 5 hours (from town-1 to town-2) + 1 hour (waiting
time at town-2) + 5 hours (from town-2 to town-5) = 11 hours.

1 2 6 

Explanation :

The first line contains 4 space separated integers, N, M, S and T.
Next M lines contains two space separated integers each, U and V
denoting that there is a bidirectional road between town U and town V.
Next line contains two space separated integers, X and Y.
Possible routes :
1->2->4->5->6
1->2->3->5->6
1->2->6
1->5->6

Fastest path will be 1−>2−>6. ( lexicographically smallest )

Reach town-2 in 4 hours. After 4 hours at the SBT in town-2 will change its
operating state to Busy and then to operating. So in town-2, no need to wait for the SBT to change
its operating state.
So total time will be 4 hours (from town-1 to town-2) + 4 hours (from town-2 to town-6) = 8 hours.
