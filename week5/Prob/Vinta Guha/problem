 In Vinaynagara kingdom, Devaraya has ordered the education minister to come up with a wonderful
amusement park for kids to play. The education minister responded promptly and constructed a
beautiful park with lots of funny games.

One of the games, ‘Vinta Guha’ (Novel Cave). The cave had compartments that form a NxN grid. Each
compartment was either empty (0), mango (1) or closed (-1). The game was to enter into the cave and
win as many mangoes as possible. There were some interesting rules to get those mangoes from those
compartments of the grid.

The rules are as follows:

1. One can pass through an empty compartment.
2. The compartment with a mango becomes empty once the mango is picked up.
3. Compartments either empty or with mangoes are considered valid to pass through.
4. First compartment (0, 0) and Last compartment (N-1, N-1) are always either empty (0) or have
mangoes (1). They are never closed (-1)
5. Always start from first compartment (0, 0), move right or down and reach last compartment
(N-1, N-1). In way, pick up mangoes (if found) and make that compartment empty.
6. On reaching last compartment (N-1, N-1), resume the journey back to compartment (0, 0) by
moving left or upper valid compartments.
7. Repeat (4) and (5) till is it impossible to pass through compartments due the rules of movement
as defined in (4) and (5).

Given the grid, find out the maximum number of mangoes that a kid can win.
Print 0 if there is no path from start point to end point.

Sample input :
3
0 1 -1
1 0 -1
1 1 1

Sample output :
5

Explanation :

● The player started at (0, 0) and went down, down, right, right to
reach (2, 2).
● 4 mangoes were picked up during this single trip, and the matrix
becomes [[0 1 -1], [0 0 -1], [0 0 0]].
● Then, the player went left, up, up, left to return home, picking up
one more mango.
● The total number of mangoes picked up is 5, and this is the
maximum possible.

Sample input :
3
1 -1 1
1 -1 0
0 1 1

Sample output :
4


Explanation :

● The player started at (0, 0) and went down, down, right, right to
reach (2, 2).

● 4 mangoes were picked up during this single trip, and the matrix
becomes [[0 -1 1], [0 -1 0], [0 0 0]].

● There is a chance of blocking if he tried to pick a mango placed on (0,2) position while returning home(0,0) he can't move down and left there is a closed compartment.

● So, the player went left,left, up, up to return home with out picking any mango.

● The total number of mangoes picked up is 4, and this is the
maximum possible.
